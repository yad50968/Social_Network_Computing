I use BeautifulSoup to parser the html.
And there is only one problem I encounted.

That is I don't know how to get the string from soup.findAll()
after loop up lots of website, I found the answer:   use strip()

and when I parse the content , it should x.string.strip() to get the content
because there are some pictures url , and it will get trouble.
so I use x.string and get the content.
